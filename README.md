# DentalClinic

This is a project for the subject Programming Technique 2. In this project, our team decided to make Dental Clinic Management for 
Covid-19.

=== HOW IT WORKS ===
1. patient sets an appointment date
2. if appointment date is empty, nurse will update the patient record (name,age ,etc).
3. nurse screens the patient and determine whether the patient is suitable for treatment (temp, illness)
	- if temp is higher than 37.5 then cancel appointment

4. nurse updates patient's current temperature and symptoms in patient record
5. dentist treats patient.
6. nurse update the medicine , symptoms and instruction of patient
7.
